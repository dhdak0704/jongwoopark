Hello. I am Jongwoo Park, a researcher at the KATECH(Korea Automotive Technology Institue).
I am currently working on the field of 'Driver Misuse and System Performance Limitations in Autonomous Vehicles'.
My final research goal is to provide safe vehicles considering both driver misuse and system performance limitations.
