Research Title: Development of an Inattention Reduction Device based on Brainwave Assessment

Sponsor: HYUNDAI MOBIS
Research Period: 2021.05.31 - 2021.12.31
Participation Period: 2021.09.01 - 2021.12.31

Research Goal: Verification of the effectiveness of a warning system in a brainwave-based driver drowsiness and inattention reduction device (earset).

Research Introduction:
This research focuses on the development and effectiveness verification of an inattention reduction device (earset) that provides auditory warnings based on the driver's EEG to detect drowsiness and inattention.
The earset is worn in the form of an earphone on the user’s right ear, capturing brainwave signals around the right ear.
The acquired brainwave signals are analyzed by an algorithm to determine the user’s inattention state.
If the inattention state indicator exceeds a certain level, the earset provides an auditory warning alert to the user.
Simultaneously, the user can monitor their current inattention state in real-time via the mBrain mobile application.
This research validated the inattention reduction effectiveness of the earset device with bus drivers in Gyeonggi Province.
As a result, the application of the earset device led to a decrease in the frequency of driver inattention incidents.
The findings of this research may lead to further studies combining auditory alerts with ambient visual warnings and tactile alerts from seat vibrations to enhance inattention reduction.
