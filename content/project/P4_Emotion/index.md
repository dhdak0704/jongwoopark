Keywords: driver’s emotion, driver anger, road rage, emotion induction, physiological signals

Research Goal: Study on the characteristics of physiological signals during driver anger induction in a vehicle simulator environment.

Research Introduction:
This research focuses on inducing anger in drivers using emotion induction techniques within a vehicle simulator environment and studying the characteristics of physiological signals during the anger state.
To appropriately induce anger in drivers, a combination of emotion induction techniques was used, including visual stimuli (video), autobiographical recall, and simulator driving.
The study found changes in physiological signals (such as heart rate and respiration) in the angry state compared to the neutral baseline state of the drivers.
The findings of this research will be utilized for the development and validation of driver emotion recognition systems.
