Research Title: Development of Motion Sickness Reduction Metrics

Sponsor: HYUNDAI MOBIS
Research Period: 2022.01.03 - 2022.10.31
Participation Period: 2022.08.01 - 2022.10.31
 * Participated in the research as a master's student at Kookmin University
 
Role: Practical Assistant (Contribution: 10%)

Keywords: Motion sickness, electroencephalogram (EEG)

Research Goal: Development of elements to reduce passenger motion sickness and verification of their effectiveness.

Research Introduction:
This research aims to develop and verify the effectiveness of motion sickness reduction elements for passengers using a vehicle simulator and real-world driving environments. The motion sickness reduction elements are categorized into three main types: lateral information display (visual), longitudinal information headrest alerts (auditory), and motion sickness prevention scents (olfactory).
Passengers were seated in the second row of a vehicle driving on an urban test road (PG) while performing non-driving-related tasks (NDRT) to induce motion sickness.
As a result, the study identified the effectiveness of various combinations of motion sickness reduction elements.
The findings of this research are intended to be utilized to reduce motion sickness in passengers of autonomous and electric vehicles.
